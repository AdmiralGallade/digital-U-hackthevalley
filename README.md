# Digital U
A fun Whatsapp Bot that talks on your behalf. It can be used by someone who is extremely busy but still wants to keep in touch with his/her friends.
 
## Motivation
The motivation behind this was the posibility of having a computer keep in touch with someone while you have an exam due. This could be really helpful in some ways but again I wouldnt want to keep talking to a machine, so this only meant to send a few messages to keep the person in loop and aware about you.
